# Wundern-Game-Engine
Console-Based Game Engine


All script you want to add should be in scripts folder
There are home-made scripts by me like (Rigidbody,Movement,Collision,PlayerPositionText)

When you want to create a new script use ScriptTemplate.cs in scripts folder then copy the content of it


From Gif It seems slow but because of the video :)
